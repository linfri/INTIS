# INTIS (INTENT Insights)

[INTENT](https://archive.org/download/linfri-repo/INTENT.pdf) is an ongoing compilation series that encourages and inspires electronic and experimental music artists from all over the world to create their own reality by setting intentions for the coming year. The idea behind INTENT stems from three different sources: the [book](https://books.google.se/books/about/Biocentrism.html?id=xG05rnLfqO8C) “Biocentrism: How Life and Consciousness are the Keys to Understanding the True Nature of the Universe” by Robert Lanza and Bob Berman, the art installation [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_Tree_(Yoko_Ono_art_series)) “Wish Tree” by Yoko Ono, and the workshop “Sätt din intention” held by Aleksandra Chaladus in Shine Café & Holistic Center (Stockholm, Sweden) in December 2019. The compilation series has been produced annually since 2020 by Linn Friberg from Sweden and released via the French netlabel [Kalamine Records](https://kalaminerecords.com).

The INTIS (INTENT Insights) dashboard provides data visualization of the distribution of contributing artists according to their countries of origin. If you click on a country’s outline, you will be able to see information about artists from that country who have contributed, as well as the total number of contributions from the country. The totals for contributions, artists, countries, and modes for artists and countries (top artist/country) are provided as well. The presence of international collaborations results in a slightly higher number of contributions than the total number of tracks; for example, one track featuring two artists from different countries counts as two contributions.

The data is available for the whole project as well as for the separate installments. INTIS also allows you to research the artists further; by clicking on the artist name in the Artist Discovery field, you will be able to see the results of a Google search on the artist name.

The dashboard can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/linfri/INTIS/blob/main/INTIS.html) as HTML file. Make sure to download the file via "Save Link As..."
